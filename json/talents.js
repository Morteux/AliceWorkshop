Bolstering Bubblebalms will bounce between nearby opponents, dealing Hydro DMG based on Sigewinne's max HP to opponents it hits. When it hits an opponent, it will restore HP to all nearby party members except Sigewinne herself. The amount healed is based on Sigewinne's max HP. After bouncing 5 times, the Bolstering Bubblebalm will disappear and restore HP to Sigewinne herself based on her own max HP value. When no opponents are present, the Bolstering Bubblebalm will bounce nearby. Only one Bolstering Bubblebalm created by a Sigewinne may exist at once. Hold Enter Aiming Mode, and blow an even bigger, even more breathtaking Bolstering Bubblebalm! The Bolstering Bubblebalm will grow bigger the longer the skill is Held, until it grows in size twice. For each tier in size it grows, the DMG it deals to opponents it hits increases by 5%, and the healing provided to nearby characters increases by 5%. After weaker opponents are hit by big Bolstering Bubblebalms, they will be imprisoned and will be unable to move. When big Bolstering Bubblebalms bounce, they will drop down a tier in size, until they return to being normal Bolstering Bubblebalms. In addition, 2 Sourcewater Droplets will be created near Sigewinne when she uses Rebound Hydrotherapy. Each Sourcewater Droplet Sigewinne absorbs will grant her a Bond of Life worth 10% of her Max HP. When Sigewinne's Bond of Life is cleared, she regains 1 Elemental Energy for every 2,000 HP worth of the Bond of Life that was cleared. Sigewinne can regain up to 5 Elemental Energy in this way.
